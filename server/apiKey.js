// In a real application, I would never commit an API key directly to the codebase.
// (I would instead use git-secret or a token/secrets configuration common to deployment setups.)
// But, in this case, it's the easiest thing to do.
// That way, I don't have to grant access to each interviewer/reviewer who might run this locally.
